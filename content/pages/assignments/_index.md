Writing Assignments
-------------------

There are a total of four writing assignments, which vary in terms of their genre, length, and complexity. They include: a critical review; a science essay for the general public; a prospectus for the science essay; and a proposal. Together, these assignments are designed to give you experience with different genres of scientific and technical writing and a foundation for eventually mastering the specific kinds of writing associated with your field and future profession.

"Main" writing assignments (250 words = ~1 page):

1.  [A critical review]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/assignment-1-a-critical-review) (≥1250 words, to be revised)
2.  [A prospectus for a science essay]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/assignment-2-a-prospectus-for-a-science-essay) (≥250 words; to be revised if requested by instructor)
